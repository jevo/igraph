# iGraph-Lite

This is the source code for iGraph-Lite, my tool for helping blind and
visually impaired people gain access to the information contained in
statistical charts. For more information, please read the
[manual](http://www.inf.udec.cl/~leo/ig.pdf), or visit my
[homepage](http://leoferres.github.io/research/igraph.html).

This is a Visual C\# 4.5, built on Visual Studio 2010.

Although I don't actively maintain iGraph anymore, I'm still
interested in seeing its development continued. If anyone would like
to help me get it in better shape, please don't hesitate to send me
[email](mailto:leoferres@gmail.com) ,and ask for a pull.
